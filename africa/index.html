<h1>Putative Migration Waves Out of Africa</h1>

<br> 
<p>The migration of early humans is the earliest example of migrations and expansions of modern and ancient <br> humans across continents. The migrations are predicted to have started about 2 million years ago, with the Homo <br> Erectus early travels out of Africa. This migration was followed by other ancient humans, such as Homo <br> Heidelbergensis, which lived 500,000 years ago. About 300,000 years ago, in Africa, early modern humans spread <br> around the time of their speciation. The African origin theory implies that Homo Sapiens living outside of Africa <br> descended from a population who migrated from East Africa 70-50,000 years ago, disseminating along the southern coast <br> of Asia and to Oceania about 50,000 years ago, and populating Europe about 40,000 years ago. As well, archaic <br> Eurasian human fossils, which date from 177,000 to 210,000 years old, have been discovered in both Greece <br>and Palestine. These fossils are thought to represent failed migration attempts by modern humans, who were most probably <br> replaced by local Neanderthals. After the final Glacial Maximum, North Eurasian populations migrated to the Americas about <br> 20,000 years ago. Arctic Canada, as well as Greenland, was reached by the Paleo-Eskimo migration 4,000 years ago. <br> Polynesia was colonized in the past 2,000 years in the last migration wave of the Austronesians.</p>

<p3 id='h1' style='display: none'> Mezmaiskaya Cave, or Мезмайская пещера, is an archaic cave site that overlooks the right bank of the Sukhoi Kurdzhips <br> in the southern Russian Republic of Adygea, in the northwestern hills of the North Caucasus in the Caucasus Mountains. <br> The first excavations of the Mezmaiskaya Cave uncovered Mousterian artifacts of the Last Glacial Maximum. In another <br> exhumation, three Neanderthal individuals were retrieved from the cavern. The first of the three, dubbed Mezmaiskaya 1, <br> was found in 1993 and is an almost complete skeleton in a well-preserved state. Mezmaiskaya 1 was determined to be <br> an infant that was about two weeks old, making it the youngest Neanderthal retrieved. Mezmaiskaya 1 is incidentally dated to <br> around 70-60,000 years ago. As well, 24 skull fragments of a 1-2-year-old Neanderthal child, or Mezmaiskaya 2, were found in <br>  1994. A recovered tooth was assigned to Mezmaiskaya 3. Mezmaiskaya 2 is from around 44,600-42,960 BP. As well, data analysis <br> reveals that Mezmaiskaya 2 was a male. </p3>


<p4 id='h2' style='display: none'> Vindija Cave is an archaeological site associated with Neanderthals and modern humans. The cave is located in the city <br> of Donja Voća, in northern Croatia. The cave is located about 20 km west of the city of Varaždin and 10 km north of Ivanec. <br> It is estimated that Neanderthals used 40,000 years ago, which is about 8000 years before modern humans populated that <br> area of Europe. The hominid specimens discovered are regarded as Neanderthals, but they share multiple traits with modern <br> Europeans rather than the traditional Neanderthal. These traits include a thinner brow ridge, reduced face size, as well as <br> smaller front teeth.  </p4>


<p5 id='h3' style='display: none'> Peștera cu Oase or the Cave with Bones is a cave system of 12 chambers located close to the city of Anina, in Caras-Severin <br> county, southwestern Romania. This cave is where some of the oldest early European modern human remains have been uncovered, <br> which date from 37,000 to 42,000 years old. In 2003, a research team discovered new remains on the cave’s surface. An entire <br> cranial skeleton was found, along with a mostly complete left temporal bone and several bone segments. Oase 1 exhibits <br> morphological traits from both early modern and archaic humans, such as Neanderthal features. As well, additional DNA <br> analysis of Oase 1 since 2015 has allowed for many significant discoveries. </p5>


<p6 id='h4' style='display: none'> The Qafzeh-Skhul early modern human remains are hominin fossils that were uncovered in the Es-Skhul and Qafzeh <br> caves in Israel. Today, these remains are classified as Homo Sapiens and are the earliest of their species in Eurasia. Skhul <br> Cave is located on the inclines of Mount Carmel, while Qafzeh Cave is a cave near Nazareth, Lower Galilee. The Skhul <br> remains, which are Skhul 1-9, were discovered from 1929 to 1935 in a chamber in Es-Skhul Cave in Mount Carmel. <br> The fossils were of seven adults and three children, and some of these, Skhul 1, 4, and 5, are thought to have been graves. <br> The Qafzeh cave opens onto a wall of Wadi el Hadj in Mount Precipice. Exploration of the cave was begun in 1934 by <br> René Neuville and ended in the discovery of the remains of five people. As well, in the lower layers of the caves, which <br>dated back to 92,000 years ago, a series of hearths, human bodies, flint objects, animal bones, a cortical flake, seashells, <br> and lumps of red ochre were found. Fossils of 15 hominids, dating back to 95,000 years ago, were recovered from Qafzeh. <br> 8 of the 15 remains were identified as children, and the remains of Qafzeh 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 15 were classified as burials.
 </p6>


<p7 id='h5' style='display: none'> The Fuyan Cave, or 福岩洞, is a system of limestone caves in Tangbei village, Lefutang town, Daoxian, Hunan province, <br> in south-central China. Fuyan Cave is famous for the uncovering of the oldest evidence for unmistakably fully modern <br> humans outside Africa. 47 human teeth, which dated from 80,000 to 120,000 years ago, were discovered there. The teeth <br> were considered unusual for not showing any indications of cavities, something typically not found in teeth older than <br> 50,000 years ago. However, a later DNA analysis found that these remains were younger than was previously presumed. </p7>


<p8 id='h6' style='display: none'> The Liujiang men, or 柳江人, are among the earliest Homo Sapiens found in East Asia. The remains of the Liujiang <br> men were found in the Tongtianyan Cave in Liujiang, Guangxi, China. The remains of the hominids were excavated <br> in 1958. The fossils are comprised of a well-preserved adult cranium, a right hip bone, a complete sacrum, multiple <br> vertebrae, and two femoral fragments. All of these remains are thought to have belonged to one individual. Little <br> information about the fossils because of a lack of academic papers released in the United States. As well, the Liujiang <br> specimen was found to have many similarities to modern-day East and Southeast Asian people. The remains are thought <br> to date from approximately the Late Pleistocene to 68,000 years ago. </p8>


<p9 id='h7' style='display: none'> The term Herto Man refers to the 160-154,000-year-old Homo Sapien remains. The fossils were found in 1997 <br> in the Upper Herto Member of the Bouri Formation in the Afar Triangle, Ethiopia. The uncovering of Herto Man<br> was particularly important at the time since it fell within a gap in the fossil record between 300-100,000 years ago, <br> making Herto Man the oldest-to-date Homo  Sapien fossil. Herto Man is thought to have created several stone tools <br> that can fit into the vague term of Transitional Acheulean, which is the tradition with both Acheulean and Middle <br> Stone Age tools. Herto Man might have been killing hippo and bovines in a lakeside environment. The three most<br> complete skulls have cut marks and several other alterations, which could be proof of burial traditions. </p9>


<p10 id='h8' style='display: none'> Tracking the travels of archaic modern humans has been problematized by human migrations both out of and into Africa. <br> Gallego Llorente sequenced an Ethiopian individual dubbed Mota, who lived around 4,500 years ago, preceding a <br>migration surge of individuals into Africa from Eurasia. Genetic data suggest modern-day Sardinians were the potential <br> origin of Eurasian counter flux. Additionally, 4-7% of African genomes, like Yoruba and Mbuti Pygmies, are derived <br> from this Eurasian genotype.  </p10>


<p11 id='h9' style='display: none'> The Youngest Toba eruption was a supervolcanic explosion that occurred 75,000 years ago at present-day Lake Toba in <br> Sumatra, Indonesia. The Toba eruption is one of the Earth’s largest known explosive combustions. The Toba catastrophe <br> theory states that this eruption caused a global volcanic winter of 6-10 years and conceivably a 1,000-year cooling period. <br>In 1993, Ann Gibbons, a science journalist, proposed that a population decrease happened in human adaptation approximately <br> 70,000 years ago. Gibbons expressed that this could have been caused by the Toba eruption. In 1998, Gibbon’s theory <br>was further researched by Stanley H. Ambrose, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The link <br> between the evolution of early modern humans and the eruption, and the global winter theories, are extremely controversial. <br> The exact spread of modern human populations at the time of the eruption is unknown, but groups that survived may have afterward <br> travelled to other areas of the world. Analyses of DNA have estimated that major travels from Africa transpired 60,000-70,000 years ago,<br> which is consistent with the Youngest Toba eruption about 75,000 years ago. </p11>


<p12 id='h10' style='display: none'> Denisova Cave, or Денисова пещера, is a cave located in the Bashelaksky Range of the Altai mountains, in Siberia, Russia. <br> Items such as bone fragments of the Denisova hominin and artifacts to around 40,000 BP originate from this cave.  The cave <br> is situated in a place thought to have been inhabited by Neanderthals and modern humans. Neanderthals and related hybrids <br> could have lived in the Denisova Cave for long periods, but likely not at the same time. It is uncertain if the needle and other <br> objects in the cave belong to either Homo Sapiens or the Denisova Hominin, also known as Homo Denisova. </p12>


<p13 id='h11' style='display: none'> Jebel Irhoud, or جبل إيغود, is an archeological site situated north of Tlet Ighoud, 50 km southeast of Safi, Morocco. <br> The site is noted for the discoveries of hominid fossils that have been found since the initial finding of the site in <br> 1960. Thought originally to be neanderthals, the uncovered specimens have since been classified as Homo Sapiens <br> or Homo Helmei, and as of 2017, have been dated to roughly 300,000 years ago. Excavations of the site have uncovered <br>several fossils, which are Irhoud 1, a skull, Irhoud 2, part of another skull, Irhoud 3, the lower mandible of a child, Irhoud 4, <br>a humerus, and Irhoud 5, a hip bone. Further digging carried out by American researchers and another team led by Jean-Jacques <br> Hublin have discovered animal remains. These animal fossils have allowed the archaic ecology of the area to be reconstructed <br>by scientists. The ecology is thought to have been a dry, open and prairie habitat, roamed by bovids, gazelles, rhinoceros, <br> and various other predators. </p13>


<p14 id='h12' style='display: none'> The Lake Mungo remains, found in New South Wales, Australia,  are the three most prominent sets of human remains <br> that could be Aboriginal Australian. Mungo woman, or Lake Mungo 1, was uncovered in 1969 by Jim Bowler and <br> is one of the oldest known cremations. As well, the preservation of the fossils is quite poor. Very little data was <br> published before the bones were given to the Australian Indigenous people in 1992. The repatriation caused a <br> limited supply of bone casts and lack of information made it difficult to assess the published papers. The remains <br> dubbed Mungo man, or Lake Mungo 3, were found in 1974 by geomorphologist Jim Bowler and are dated to around <br>40,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch. Mungo Man, or Lake Mungo 3, is the oldest Homo Sapien fossil <br> discovered in Australia. It is thought that Lake Mungo 3 was an example of a burial practice performed by early humans.  </p14>


<p15 id='h13' style='display: none'> The Omo remains are a series of hominin bones discovered from 1967-1974 at the Omo Kibish archaeological sites <br> near the Omo River, in Omo National Park, Ethiopia. The fossils were discovered by a scientific team directed by <br> Richard Leaky. The bones found at Kamoya’s Hominid Site, or KHS, were dubbed Omo I, while those from PHS, <br> or Paul I. Abell’s Hominid Site, were called Omo II. The fossils found at the sites include two incomplete skulls, <br> four jaw bones, a leg bone, about two hundred teeth, as well as several other parts. Omo I and Omo II are <br>categorized as Homo Sapiens but vary from each other with numerous traits. As well, the Omo I fossils <br> consist of more modern biological characteristics, while Omo II displays some primal traits. </p15>


<p16 id='h14' style='display: none'> The Homo Luzonensis, or the Ubag, is an extinct species of ancient humans from the Last Pleistocene located <br> in Luzon, Philippines. The fossils of this species were found only in Callao Cave and are thought to date back <br> to 50,000 years ago. In 2010, the remains were defined as belonging to Homo Sapiens, but after the finding of <br> more specimens in 2019, they were classified as a new species. The ancestors of this species, who may have <br> been the Asian Homo Erectus, must have made a sea crossing of several kilometres to reach the island  <br> of the Philippines. The first of the remains were found in 2007 in Northern Luzon and were categorized <br> in 2010 as modern human remains. In 2019, however, due to the finding of 12 new fossils and the existence of <br> both modern and primitive characteristics, scientists recategorized the bones to a new species, called Homo Luzonensis, <br> the term being derived from the name of the island. </p16>
